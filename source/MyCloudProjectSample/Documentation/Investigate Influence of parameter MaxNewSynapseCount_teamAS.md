# ML22/23-13 Investigate Influence of parameter MaxNewSynapseCount - Azure Cloud Implementation
## Introduction
Temporal memory algorithms have gained popularity as a promising approach for modeling temporal sequences in machine learning. The objective of this project is to explore the effects of varying the MaxNewSynapseCount parameter within a temporal memory algorithm. This algorithm, inspired by the principles of cortical columns and the neocortex, plays a critical role in sequence learning and prediction by leveraging sparse distributed representations (SDR). Our goal is to analyze how different settings of this parameter influence the algorithm's accuracy and learning speed, particularly in complex, multi-sequence learning scenarios.

To enhance the reliability and scalability of our experiments, we are executing this project on the Azure Cloud. Running the analysis in a cloud environment offers several advantages over traditional local execution. Azure's scalable infrastructure allows us to process large datasets and execute computationally intensive tasks with greater efficiency. The cloud also facilitates seamless integration of various services, such as data storage, real-time monitoring, and automated deployments, which are crucial for handling extensive experimentation and data analysis.

Moreover, by leveraging Azure's distributed computing capabilities, we can parallelize our experiments, leading to faster iteration cycles and more comprehensive exploration of the parameter space. This approach not only improves the robustness of our findings but also ensures that our methodology can be easily scaled and adapted to future research initiatives.

In summary, implementing this project on Azure Cloud provides us with the computational power, flexibility, and scalability required to conduct a thorough investigation of the MaxNewSynapseCount parameter's impact, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of temporal memory algorithms in machine learning.

The experiment Docker image can be pulled from the Azure Container Registry using the instructionsÂ below.
~~~
docker login teamascr.azurecr.io -u teamascr -p tLBIdMrZP+obaZewqvnIX3eh2SiRKtQnpr3INkSOwl+ACRBp60xL
~~~
~~~
docker pull teamascr.azurecr.io/mycloudproject:teamas
~~~

then run 
~~~
docker-compose build
~~~ 

The docker image will be build

## How to run the experiment
## Step1 : Message input from azure portal
at a message to queues inside Azure storage account.
p.s Uncheck "Encode the message body in Base64"

**How to add message :** 

Azure portal > Home > RG-teamAS | Queues > teamasqueue> Add message
![image](images/queue_message.png)

### Queue Message that will trigger the experiment:
~~~json
{
  "ExperimentId": "1",
  "InputFile": "run-team-as-project",
  "Description": "Team AS Cloud Computing Implementation",
  "ProjectName": "ML22/23-13 Investigate Influence of parameter MaxNewSynapseCount",
  "GroupName": "team-as",
  "Students": [ "Fathir Shishir", "Akash Saha" ],
  "file1": "file_1.json",
  "file2": "file_2.json"
}
~~~

Go to "teamas10th," "Containers," and "logs" to make sure the experiment is being run from a container instance.

when the experiment  is successful bellow message(Experiment complete successfully) will be shown. Experiment successfully

## Step2: Describe the Experiment Training Input Container

Before the experiments are starting, the input files are stored in ``` teamastrainingcontainer``` 

After the queue message received, this files are read from the container and the project is started.

## Step3: Describe the Experiment Result Output Container

after the experiments are completed, the result file is stored in Azure storage blob containers
