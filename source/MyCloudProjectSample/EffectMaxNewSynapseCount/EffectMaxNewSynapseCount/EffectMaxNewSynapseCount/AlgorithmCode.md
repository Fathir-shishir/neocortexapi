# MultiSequenceLearning Experiment with Varying MaxNewSynapseCount

## Steps:

### Step 1: Modify MaxSynapsesPerSegment
At first, we modify the value of MaxSynapsesPerSegment in the HTM configuration. This parameter determines the maximum number of new synapses that can be created for each segment during learning. Adjusting this value affects the system's ability to form new connections and learn from input patterns.

### Step 2: Collect results in a log file
Then, we introduce a writer interface to log the experimental results to a text file. This interface is responsible for recording key metrics such as the MaxSynapsesPerSegment value used, learning speed, prediction accuracy, and any other relevant information that will help in analyzing the system's performance.

### Step 3: Run Experiments with Varied MaxSynapsesPerSegment Values
Next, we run multiple experiments, each time varying the MaxSynapsesPerSegment and test input data to observe how changes in this parameter affect the HTM system. For each experiment, the system is reset or reinitialized to ensure independent and unbiased results.

### Step 4: Log Results for Each Experiment
For every experiment conducted, we log the results using the writer interface created in Step 2. This includes detailed information on the learning process, how quickly the system reaches a stable state, and the accuracy of its predictions.

### Step 5: Analyze the Logged Data
After running the experiments, we analyze the logged data to understand the impact of different MaxNewSynapseCount values. We look for trends in learning speed and prediction accuracy, aiming to identify the optimal MaxNewSynapseCount setting for our HTM system.

### Step 6: Adjust the HTM Configuration Based on Findings
Based on the analysis, we adjust the MaxNewSynapseCount in the HTM configuration to the identified optimal value. This step may involve further experimentation and refinement to fine-tune the system's performance.

### Step 7: Document the Experimentation Process and Results

### Step 8: Import the SE project

### Step 9: Export all projects
