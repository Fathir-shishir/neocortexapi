## Algorithm Overview
The Temporal Memory algorithm is implemented within the TemporalMemory class in the MultiSequenceLearning project. This algorithm utilizes various parameters, including MaxNewSynapseCount, during the learning process.

### Steps Taken
1. Identification of Temporal Memory Implementation:
	Located the implementation of the Temporal Memory algorithm within the TemporalMemory class.

2. Analysis of Parameter Usage:
	Identified the usage of the ```MaxNewSynapseCount``` parameter within the code, particularly during dendrite segment growth.

3. Review of Additional Parameters:
	Examined the roles of additional parameters such as ```ActivationThreshold``` and ```CellsPerColumn``` in conjunction with ```MaxNewSynapseCount```.
	
4. Examination of Dendrite Segment Growth:
	Focused on the code responsible for dendrite segment growth to understand how ```MaxNewSynapseCount``` influences this process.

5. Recording Synapse Creation Logic:
	Documented the logic governing the creation of new synapses, paying specific attention to the conditions influenced by ```MaxNewSynapseCount```.
